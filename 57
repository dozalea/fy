  Here is Jerry's Details on Data!:

    Data is the raw material of knowledge. For example, a person's name, a 
    material, or even just an answer to a survey! However, when a bunch of data is 
    combined, it becomes a lot more complex and powerful. For example, if a company
    can link you to your name, your age, and your location and other things about 
    you, then they can use to figure out what you might want to buy. Many social 
    media companies use data to either sell your data to other companies, or use it
    to to sell you things.

    This sounds really scary, but the Data Protection Act 2018 helps protect your 
    data. It protects your data by making sure that it can't be used for illegal 
    purposes, and that companies can only keep it for a certain period of time. 
    Furthermore, it means that you have the right to view what the company has stored
    about you, and you have the right to request that the company erase your data.

    Terms of service are legal agreements between a company and its users. They
